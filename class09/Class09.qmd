##PDB Statistics

Today we will be using the Data Export Summary from PDB to figure out the following questions

```{r}
 db <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
```

> Q1. What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
xray.total <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","", db$X.ray)))
em.total <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","", db$EM)))
```

```{r}
# use `x` has input 
sum.comma <- function(x) {
  #substitute comma and convert to numeric 
  sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","", x)))
}
```

For x-ray:

```{r}
sum.comma(db$X.ray) / sum.comma(db$Total)
```

For EM:

```{r}
round(sum.comma(db$EM) / sum.comma(db$Total),2)
```

> Q2. What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
round(sum.comma(db$Total[1])/sum.comma(db$Total),2)
```

> Q3. Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

##Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

The structure is too low to see a resolution of H atoms. We need a sub 1 Angstrom resolution to see Hydrogen.

> Q5: There is a critical "conserved" water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have?

HOH308

# Working wit Structures in R 

We can use the `bio3d` package to read and perform bioinformatics about calculations on PDB structures. 

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb

```

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

Read an ADK structure 
```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

Perform a prediction of flexibility with a technique callled NMA(normal mode analysis) 

```{r}
# predict flexibility 
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

Write out a "movie" (a.k.a trajectory) of the motion for viewing in MOlstar
```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```

> Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 

198 

>Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

MK1

> Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure?
